design parking lot
Lets understand the flow first:
Vehicle arrives at an Entry gate .
We can have multiple entry gate
Based on Vehicle Type, particular parking spot is looked for.
Interviewer can ask for flexibility in choosing the parking spot like random, or any specific
parking strategy
Also interviewer can say, parking lot can have multiple levels.
Concurrency should be handled properly, for example:
Same parking spot can not be reserved by two different vehicles.
for 1 vehicle say two wheeler we should not block the whole parking lot itself
If Parking spot is available, Ticket is generated for particular vehicle
a. Ticket can have: vehicle no, parking level no, parking spot no and Entry time.
At Exit gate, cost computation should have happened, Interviewer can ask for different
strategies for cost computation like:
a. Fixed price
b. Hourly based computation etc.
Payment will be made against the ticket at Exit gate and Parking spot is free again.
Based on above understanding, we identified the below major objects involved in this design:

Lets start creating the UML: and java code same like above
